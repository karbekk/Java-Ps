Classes : Provide structures for describing and creating objects

Usually source file is same name as the class name.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Classes are reference types;

Eg:

Flight flight1 = new Flight();
FLight flight2 = new Flight();

flight2.addPassenger();                   -- flight2 pass = 1

flight2 = flight1;

flight1.addPassenger();                   -- flight2 pass = 1;
flight1.addPassenger();                   -- flight2 pass = 2;

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation or data hiding : close ties bw attributes + behaviour and protecting them

this is accomplished through access modifiers.

Types of AM:

1. No access modifier: - visibility through out the package

2. public : anywhere

3. private : only within the class

Note : Public classes must have the same name as that of source file name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

this -> referes to the current object
