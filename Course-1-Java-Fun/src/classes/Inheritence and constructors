Constructors cannot be inherited.

But derived classes must always call one of the base class constructor.

If you don't explicitly call the base class constructor, then default no argument base class constructor will be called.
from derived class even though derived class constructor has arguments.

If you want a particular base class constructor from derived class then, super keyword needs to be used.

But the super has  to be the first line of the code in derived class method.
