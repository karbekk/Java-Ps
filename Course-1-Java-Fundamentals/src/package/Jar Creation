1. Go to project structure in IntellijIdea
2. Go to artifacts
3. add new -> jar file.
4. choose from module dependencies.
5. choose the main method for entry point.
    this created a manifest file with the main method as entry point.

 --------------------------

 Now go to intellijidea -> go to build -> build artifacts -> calcengine:jar -> build

 --------------------------

 go to your out folder to see the jar and manifest file both in diff places though

 go to where jar file is in terminal.

 run the jar as -> java -jar Calcengine.jar

 Note: The whole source folder is archived in my project case with all the notes in it.

 But since the manifest file concentrates on entry point main -> only class files are run.

 The jar file in windows is nothing but a zip file. so you can rename it as zip and explore it.

 the Jar file as - 1. Manifest file inside it to tell the entry point
                   2. then the package name in folder structure.


 Note : Jar file is a combination of diff packages as well.

 =======================================

 Creating diff packages means dependencies. so add necessary import statements.

  either add each class import one by one or by *
