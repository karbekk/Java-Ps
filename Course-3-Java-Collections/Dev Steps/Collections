Collections are needed because of problems with Arrays where
printing the array values needs to do array.tostring method.

Adding a new array and printing gives error as dynamic array or resizing is not supported.

handling duplicate elements is not supported as it supports duplicates.
printing a newly created array is also a problem



Collections come with jdk.

The parent class is Collections.

Collection is divided into -> Lists  -> ArrayList, LinkedList
                              Set -> Hashset -> SortedSet (Treeset )
                              Queue is FIFO (Priority Queue)-> Deque (LinkedList,ArrayDeque) supports both thus acts like stack
                              Map -> HashMap -> Treemap (SortedMap)


 Interface vs Implementations:

 Interface has a behavior and implementation has performance and concrete instantiation
