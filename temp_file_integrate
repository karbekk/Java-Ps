// Java packages :

/*


Java packages provide organisations within a java program.
lang convention : All lowercase

a global package :

package com.example;

a custom package :

package com.example.myproj


a group package:

package com.example.management


Folder structure :
If the package name is com.company.example then, folder structure would be 

src -> com -> company -> example -> main.java 

NOTE : In, Intellij Idea

your project structure was src/main/java/start.java but when you added it to IntelliJ you have set src as a source folder, so IntelliJ put main.java as a package.

In Project Setting (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S) -> Modules -> Sources tab set src/main/java as Source Folder.
In Intellij Idea - check File > ProjectStructure > ProjectSettings > Modules > Sources - your folder must be marked as a "Source". Also you should update your Run > EditConfigurations > Configuration > Main class to correspond with your package


strongly typed - cant mix the diff variable types. Variables have fixed data type.
weakly typed - variables dont really have a type

static typing - must be declared before using
dynamic typing - use without declaration on the fly
