HTML - Markup lang for structure and content
CSS - Styling of my content
Javascript - what happens when you do something with the structure.

Its possible to right desktop applications in JS liek any other programmin lang.

JS works only inside another app. Eg: Inside web browser. All browsers have the js engine inside it

OS -> Web browser -> page -> JS 

JS doesnt have the access to local files.
Cant directly access DB
Cant access hardware

JS - Client side pgm lang.
     It interprets and executes html and css recieved from server on client browser.
     unlike server side programs which execue code on the web servers.
     We send our code to client to execute it for us. So its designed as scripting lang with browser as host.
     
     even though now we have - servir side lang - node.js.
