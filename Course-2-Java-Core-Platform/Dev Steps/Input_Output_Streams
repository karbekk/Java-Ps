Stream: ordered sequence of data

2 types: Byte stream and text stream

Reading:

Byte streams: -> Binary data 0011001 of 8 bit -> class is InputStream and read method -> returns Int which is casted back to byte.
Also, can read an array of byte[].

Text Streams -> Unicode characters of 16 bit -> Class is Reader and read method-> returns Int which is casted back to char.
Also, can read an array of char[].

Writing:

Byte streams: -> Binary data 0011001 of 8 bit -> class is OutputStream and write method -> returns void and writes int as parameter
Also, can write byte[]

Text Streams -> Unicode characters of 16 bit -> Class is Writer and write method-> returns Int which is casted back to char.
Also, can write a String or array of char[].
